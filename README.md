# Ghostwriter

This is very much a work in progress. Therefore there is no formal readme
at this time.

The project aims to implement a tool to aid in code-generation.

* Use regular Python over a home-brewn DSL
* Allow the mixing of templates Python code for code generation
   * Some inspiration from [Imatix GSL](https://github.com/imatix/gsl) and 
* Use Pratt-parser for more complex templating parsing
   * Consider tooling for designing personal DSL's
* Use a [Cog](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog)-like approach to in-line templating inside files

At a later point, this README will describe the project and inspirational sources.
